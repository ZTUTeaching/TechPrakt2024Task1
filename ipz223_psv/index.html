<h1>10 Most Poisonous Plants in the World</h2>

        <h2 class="name">10. Oleander (Nerium oleander)</h2>
        <p class="description">Originally native to Asia, the Jericho rose or oleander is now common throughout 
            Mediterranean regions and is a popular decorative plant in North America. The Italian name for oleander 
            translates as ‘ass killer’, which should be enough to put anyone off eating them! If you did eat a 
            sufficient does then you would start feeling those ‘ass killing’ effects almost straight away with a 
            combination of cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms. Bloody diarrhea, vomiting, drooling and irregular 
            heartbeat may all occur and swift treatment is essential. Toxins such as cardiac glycosides, nerioside and 
            oldendrin all contribute to oleander’s lethal armory.

            The whole oleander plant is poisonous right down to the nectar. It is said that even the smoke from 
            burning the plant is toxic and there are reports of serious poisoning resulting from using the twigs as 
            cooking skewers. What constitutes a lethal dose seems uncertain with some stating as little as one leaf. 
            Another source states 100 grams (3.5oz) is enough to kill a fully grown horse.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/white-snakeroot.jpg" alt="White snakeroot (Ageratina altissima)">
        <h2 class="name">9. White snakeroot (Ageratina altissima)</h2>
        <p class="description">It is believed that white snakeroot (Ageratina altissima) was responsible for the death 
            of American president, Abraham Lincoln’s mother. She died of what was termed milk sickness which occurred as 
            the result of drinking milk that was tainted with toxins from plants eaten by cows. In the early 19th century
             thousands of European settlers died in Midwestern America. It was only when a real life Dr Quinn (Anna Bixby) 
             learnt about the properties of snakeroot from an elderly Native American woman that the cause was discovered.

            The cause of the toxicity is a type of alcohol, tremetol, which gets its name from the tremors it causes in 
            those poisoned. Along with this there would be violent vomiting, delirium, severe thirst and ultimately death.
            
            The name snakeroot comes from the fact it can be used as a treatment when applied to snakebites.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/manchineel.jpg" alt="Manchineel (Hippomane mancinella)">
        <h2 class="name">8. Manchineel (Hippomane mancinella)</h2>
        <p class="description">Bearing fruits known as ‘little apples of death’ this is a plant to steer well clear of. Found 
            in coastal regions of Florida, South and Central America the manchineel is possibly the world’s most poisonous tree.

            Whilst the fruit is said to be potentially lethal if eaten it is the tree itself that poses the greatest threat. 
            Every part is stuffed full of powerful toxins, most notably the sap which contains phorbol, a strong skin irritant. 
            Contact with the sap provokes strong allergic dermatitis resulting in blistering of the skin. This is a particular 
            hazard during rain when anyone taking shelter under the tree’s leaves runs the risk of getting splashed with sap-laden 
            raindrops. Even a tiny amount can cause the skin to blister, not surprising as this stuff can strip paint of parked cars too!
            It is also reported that the smoke from burning the wood can cause blindness.
            
            Of course all this potential for pain didn’t go unnoticed. The Carib natives were said to use the sap on their arrowheads, 
            poison the wells of their enemies with the leaves and even tie some unfortunate victims to the trunk of the tree.</p>
