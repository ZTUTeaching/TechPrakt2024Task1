<h1>10 Most Poisonous Plants in the World</h2>

<div class="container">

        <img class="image" src="images/oleander.jpg" alt="Oleander (Nerium oleander)">
        <h2 class="name">10. Oleander (Nerium oleander)</h2>
        <p class="description">Originally native to Asia, the Jericho rose or oleander is now common throughout 
            Mediterranean regions and is a popular decorative plant in North America. The Italian name for oleander 
            translates as ‘ass killer’, which should be enough to put anyone off eating them! If you did eat a 
            sufficient does then you would start feeling those ‘ass killing’ effects almost straight away with a 
            combination of cardiac and gastrointestinal symptoms. Bloody diarrhea, vomiting, drooling and irregular 
            heartbeat may all occur and swift treatment is essential. Toxins such as cardiac glycosides, nerioside and 
            oldendrin all contribute to oleander’s lethal armory.

            The whole oleander plant is poisonous right down to the nectar. It is said that even the smoke from 
            burning the plant is toxic and there are reports of serious poisoning resulting from using the twigs as 
            cooking skewers. What constitutes a lethal dose seems uncertain with some stating as little as one leaf. 
            Another source states 100 grams (3.5oz) is enough to kill a fully grown horse.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/white-snakeroot.jpg" alt="White snakeroot (Ageratina altissima)">
        <h2 class="name">9. White snakeroot (Ageratina altissima)</h2>
        <p class="description">It is believed that white snakeroot (Ageratina altissima) was responsible for the death 
            of American president, Abraham Lincoln’s mother. She died of what was termed milk sickness which occurred as 
            the result of drinking milk that was tainted with toxins from plants eaten by cows. In the early 19th century
             thousands of European settlers died in Midwestern America. It was only when a real life Dr Quinn (Anna Bixby) 
             learnt about the properties of snakeroot from an elderly Native American woman that the cause was discovered.

            The cause of the toxicity is a type of alcohol, tremetol, which gets its name from the tremors it causes in 
            those poisoned. Along with this there would be violent vomiting, delirium, severe thirst and ultimately death.
            
            The name snakeroot comes from the fact it can be used as a treatment when applied to snakebites.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/manchineel.jpg" alt="Manchineel (Hippomane mancinella)">
        <h2 class="name">8. Manchineel (Hippomane mancinella)</h2>
        <p class="description">Bearing fruits known as ‘little apples of death’ this is a plant to steer well clear of. Found 
            in coastal regions of Florida, South and Central America the manchineel is possibly the world’s most poisonous tree.

            Whilst the fruit is said to be potentially lethal if eaten it is the tree itself that poses the greatest threat. 
            Every part is stuffed full of powerful toxins, most notably the sap which contains phorbol, a strong skin irritant. 
            Contact with the sap provokes strong allergic dermatitis resulting in blistering of the skin. This is a particular 
            hazard during rain when anyone taking shelter under the tree’s leaves runs the risk of getting splashed with sap-laden 
            raindrops. Even a tiny amount can cause the skin to blister, not surprising as this stuff can strip paint of parked cars too!
            It is also reported that the smoke from burning the wood can cause blindness.
            
            Of course all this potential for pain didn’t go unnoticed. The Carib natives were said to use the sap on their arrowheads, 
            poison the wells of their enemies with the leaves and even tie some unfortunate victims to the trunk of the tree.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/suicide-tree.jpg" alt="Suicide Tree (Cerbera odollam)">
        <h2 class="name">7. Suicide Tree (Cerbera odollam)</h2>
        <p class="description">With a name like that it is little surprise that this tree is probably responsible for most deaths than 
            any other plant. In the Indian state of Kerala alone it is thought to be responsible for around 50 deaths a year. Despite 
            being called the suicide tree the toxins work equally well for murder and the flavour is easily hidden in a bowl of spicy food.
            It is in Madagascar where Cerbera claimed most victims. Referred to as ‘ordeal poison’ it was used in the process of ‘trial 
            by ordeal’. Basically, if you survived you were innocent, if you died you were, well, dead… It is estimated that around 3,000 
            people a year died in these trials, many willingly submitting themselves to the process believing it infallible. Trial by poison 
            was finally abolished in 1861 by King Radama II.
            
            It is the seed inside the fruit of this plant that is highly poisonous. It contains the powerful alkaloid, cerberin, which is 
            similar to digoxin in foxgloves. These both work by disrupting the heart’s rhythm often with fatal results.
            Cerbera odollam is a member of the same family as the previously mentioned  oleander.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/deadly-nightshade.jpeg" alt="Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna)">
        <h2 class="name">6. Deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna)</h2>
        <p class="description">Like its family members, the potato and the tomato, deadly nightshade contain the glycoalkaloid poison 
            solanine. However, whereas you might have to eat a truck load of tomatoes to poison yourself, a single leaf of belladonna 
            might do the trick for you.

            The main toxins in deadly nightshade are atropine, scopolamine and hyoscyamine all of which affect the nervous system by 
            blocking certain neurotransmitters. Whilst all parts of the plant are toxic, the root is generally most poisonous. A dose 
            of around two to five berries is usually sufficient to kill an adult.
            
            The classic symptoms of poisoning include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dry mouth, hallucinations, loud heart beats 
            (audible several feet away), aggressive behaviour, convulsions, coma and possibly death. The effects of the poison are by 
            no means instant and may take from several hours to days to kick in.
            
            The name Atropa comes from atropine which in turn is from the Greek goddess who cut the threads of life. Belladonna means 
            ‘beautiful lady’ and refers to the 17th century practice of women putting a small extract of deadly nightshade in their eyes 
            to dilate their pupils and make them more attractive.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/jily-of-the-valley.jpg" alt="Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis)">
        <h2 class="name">5. Lily of the Valley (Convallaria majalis)</h2>
        <p class="description">Lily of the valley can be found throughout Northern Europe and America where it is common in woodland. 
            Despite its pretty appearance this plant is deadly poisonous containing no less than 38 different cardiac glycosides. Chief 
            amongst these is convallatoxin which has a similar effect to digitalis in foxgloves. All parts of the plants are toxic including 
            the orangey-red berries.

            The symptoms of lily of the valley poisoning include severe headache, nausea, vomiting, slow heartbeat and excessive urination.</p>

    <div class="card">
        <img class="image" src="images/hemlock.jpg" alt="Hemlock">
        <h2 class="name">4. Hemlock</h2>
        <p class="description">Hemlock is the poison of the classics. In ancient Greece it was used as a form of execution, most notably 
            on the philosopher Socrates in around 400 BC.

            There are a few highly poisonous varieties of hemlock; best known in Europe is Conium maculatum, or poison hemlock. In North 
            America water hemlock (Cicuta maculata) is the most infamous. Both can prove deadly if eaten.
            
            Poison hemlock contains the potent toxin coniine. It is estimated that a dose of around 0.15 grams is sufficient to kill an adult. 
            The mode of action of this poison is ‘killing from the outside in’. A numbness of the extremities slowly spreads inwards, 
            culminating in paralysis of the lungs and death. Cases of hemlock poisoning still occur, usually with people mistaking the plant 
            for something edible such as a salad ingredient. Hemlock is a member of the same family as the carrot and fennel so the highly 
            toxic root may also be consumed in error.
            
            Water hemlock is related but the toxins here, cicutoxin and cicunol, have a very different effect. These are neurotoxins and cause 
            violent, painful convulsions, cramps and tremors very different to the calm sweeping paralysis of coniine. Even those who survive 
            taking water hemlock may be afflicted with long-term damage such as amnesia.
            Water hemlock is widely regarded as the most poisonous plant in North America.</p>
