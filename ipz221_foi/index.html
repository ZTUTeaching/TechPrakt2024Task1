                New colonies of emperor penguins revealed by bird poop visible from space
            </h2>

                But they are the reason Antarctic researchers have been able to identify four new colonies of emperor penguins — a species threatened with extinction by climate change.

                A scientist from the British Antarctic Survey used satellite imagery to spot tell-tale patches of the penguins’ guano (a technical term meaning bird poop), visible from space as a series of brown smudges against the vastness of the White Continent.

                The four colonies most likely existed for years but hadn't been spotted until Peter Fretwell, a geographic information officer at the British Antarctic Survey, pored over the images. Some of the colonies appear to be moving as climate change threatens the Antarctic sea ice on which they live and breed.

                A 31-year-old dog was named the world's oldest, but doubts put his title on hold
            </h2>

                Guinness World Records said Tuesday that its oldest dog title was under formal review and that applications to be named the oldest dog living and the oldest dog ever were suspended pending the outcome.

                "A formal review into the oldest dog record is taking place, which involves GWR reviewing evidence we have on file, seeking new evidence, [and] reaching out to experts and those linked to the original application," Amanda Marcus, a spokesperson, said in a statement Tuesday.

                The Associated Press reported the review was launched after veterinarians questioned the age of the Portuguese dog that held the title. Bobi was reportedly 31 years old when he died last year.

                A baby capybara who went viral last week by dancing to Michael Jackson's "Thriller" has been given a new name by her adoring public, a Miami zoo announced on Monday.

                After receiving scores of suggestions from the community, the Florida foundation that cares for the thrilling 3-month-old giant rodent decided on a name: Eve. 

                “[She] arrived to us at the foundation on Christmas Eve, so it was only fitting, and one of our supporters nailed it by suggesting,” Matt Dillon, spokesperson for the Zoological Wildlife Foundation, told NBC News about the new name.
